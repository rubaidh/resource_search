Resource Search
===============

What's resource search all about? I started out by asking if there was a
{convention for RESTful search in
Rails}[http://woss.name/2007/07/22/convention-for-restful-search-in-rails/]
and, well, nobody responded in the positive. I then took a look at how
ActiveResource#find works for searching ActiveResource models. It turns out
that we can take that as the 'convention' and build from there.

Example
=======

A very quick example.

    class ResourceController < ApplicationController
      resource_search
      
      def index
        # ...
      end
    end
    
    class Resource < ActiveRecord::Base
    end

Now calling something along the lines of:

    http://localhost/resources?title=foo

will create a scope limiting whatever index searches for to items where
'title' is (by default) LIKE '%foo%'.

It will get better than that at some point, though, promise. :-)
